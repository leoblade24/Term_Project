This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project contains an example project board meant to showcase how one can be used. The issues posted to it are not real issues.

# Credits
The deployed heroku site: https://quiet-shelf-35148.herokuapp.com/
This project uses: grecaptcha, TypeScript, React-Bootstrap, aos (for page animations), multer, react-responsive-carousel.

#### _**IMPORTANT NOTE**_ - 
This project does not have a mongoDB connection setup. For:
- local development: create a config file (make sure to name it config.js) in the config folder, which exports your db.uri connection. An example is provided, config/config.example.js. This file will be ignored by git so your db credentials will be kept safe when the app is deployed.
- production: Since the config file is not pushed when you deploy your app, you must specify your db uri in heroku. Set the uri in heroku as specified in [this](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) resource. Make sure you name the environement variable "DB_URI".

## Getting Started
This repository aims to assist you in beginning work on a MERN stack application with a solid file structure as a foundation. To get started make a copy of this template repo for your project teams.

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. First run `yarn` from the root. From now on run this command anytime you want to install all modules again. This is a script we have defined in package.json .

> Note if you would like to install _**new**_ dependencies to the project, run `yarn add depedency_name` and replace `dependency_name` with the whatever dependency you wish to install.

This app can be deployed directly to heroku since there is a script defined in package.json which will automatically handle building and deploying the app. For more information on deploying to heroku reference the extra resources at the bottom of this file. 

## File structure
#### `client` - Holds the client application
- #### `public` - This holds all of our static files
- #### `src`
    - #### `assets` - This folder holds assets such as images, docs, and fonts
    - #### `components` - This folder holds all of the different components that will make up our views
    - #### `views` - These represent a unique page on the website i.e. Home or About. These are still normal react components.
    - #### `App.js` - This is what renders all of our browser routes and different views
    - #### `index.js` - This is what renders the react app by rendering App.js, should not change
- #### `package.json` - Defines yarn behaviors for the client defined by scripts in the next section of the README.
#### `server` - Holds the server application
- #### `config` - This holds our configuration files, like mongoDB uri
- #### `controllers` - These hold all of the callback functions that each route will call
- #### `models` - This holds all of our data models
- #### `routes` - This holds all of our HTTP to URL path associations for each unique url
- #### `tests` - This holds all of our server tests that we have defined
- #### `server.ts` - Defines yarn behaviors and packages for the client
- #### `package.json` - Defines yarn behaviors like the scripts defined in the next section of the README
- #### `package.json` - Defines the workspaces for client and server and concurrently support to run both client and server 'concurrently'.
#### `.gitignore` - Tells git which files to ignore
#### `README.md` - This file!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.

### `yarn client`

Runs just the client app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `yarn server`

Runs just the server in development mode.<br>


### `yarn build`
> Note you **MUST** execute this in the `root` directory.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

If deploying to heroku this does not need to be run since it is handled by the heroku-postbuild script<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
